## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive

### What I learned

I have learned, that I should always add landmarks. I have experienced flexbox properties and learned padding, and margin concepts by changing there values from time to time. 

### Continued development

For future projects, I expect to learn more CSS styling and how properties work such as z-indexing, transition, transform etc. 

### Useful resources
